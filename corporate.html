			<h3 id="brand-name-and-logo"> Brand Name &amp Logo</h3>
				<p>We decided to call our back brace brand Gritty since it perfectly captures the distinct personality of dachshunds. Despite their diminutive stature, dachshunds are courageous, tenacious, full of attitude; they face challenges head-on and never back down. This is the attitude that we want to capture in our brand. This type of perseverance is frequently referred to as “grit”- the ability to persevere in the face of adversity by combining courage, passion, and resilience. Grit is defined as bravery and courage  </p>
				<p>We started by thinking of what could make the logo define the brand. We all came to a consensus that we wanted some kind of resemblance of a dachshund. We also thought about adding an element to represent care which led us to trying out adding hands or hearts. Here are our first sketches: </p>
				<img src="images/corporate/initial-logos.png" alt="Initial logos" width="200">
			
				<p>After solidifying our final colour palette based on our marketing research, we went on to develop better quality drafts of our logo. We decided to keep going with the heart-shaped logo as we felt it was the most unique and represented our values best.</p>
				<img src="images/corporate/second-version-logos.png" alt="Second version logos" width="300">
			
				<p>We also wanted to use a brand mark for smaller applications (apps, garments etc): </p>
				<img src="images/corporate/brand-mark.png" alt="Brand Mark" width="150">
			
				<p>After some feedback from the team, we decided to choose the first version of the primary logo but make the colour swatches smoother since the texture seemed like a mistake.<strong>Here are the final versions of the logo, secondary logo and brand mark:</strong> </p>

			<h3 id="vision"> Vision</h3>
				<p>In a world where dachshunds are part of families, we believe this caring goes beyond the basic necessities like taking a walk, serving food and petting. In a perfect world everyone can give back the unconditional love they receive from their dog.</p>

		<h3 id="visual-identity">Visual Identity</h3>
			<p><strong>Colours:</strong> We essentially chose the colours blue and orange. Blue stands for reliability and high quality and orange for excitement. After evaluating our target group and marketing tactics we were turning more towards female preference that is why we changed orange to pink. This enlightens the more feminine side. We used the split complementary theory because of the contrast that creates a boldness that separates us from competitors.</p>
			<p><strong>Colour palette:</strong>
				<li>#162b3e Navy </li>  
				<li>#a8c2e0 Baby Blue</li>
				<li>#fff4ea Off-white</li>
				<li>#cb7278 Muted Rose</li>

			<p><strong>Stylesheet:</strong>
			<img src="images/corporate/stylesheet.png" alt="Stylesheet" width="200"></p>
			
			<p><strong>Typography:</strong> 
				<li>Headers: CoconPro Bold</li>
				<li>Subheaders: Brevia Regular</li>
				<li>Normal Text: Poppins thin</li> 
				Overall, we chose for round and playful fonts, they resemble hour value of lively expression. They give of a warm feeling that goes with devoted friendship and care.  

				The header and subheader fonts are pretty similar as the ‘normal text’ font is a little bit less playful. It makes sure the text is less distracting while reading it. It is still playful, but we chose a bit more clarity.</p>
